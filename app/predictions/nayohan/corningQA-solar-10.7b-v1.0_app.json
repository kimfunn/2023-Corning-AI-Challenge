{"question_id":1,"text":"It is \ufb02at and the effective area of the surface is equal to that of the laser spot. This ensures that the results from the outside the pattern are consistent with the enhanced Raman signal.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":2,"text":"You should definitely consider it. With the growing popularity of curved displays, I think it's time for you to take the plunge.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":3,"text":"The red color coding marks the increase in mobility for oxide semiconductors, while the black color coding shows the original mobility rate for IGZO.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":4,"text":"Definitely. I think it would be interesting to see how these technologies have evolved and are still relevant today. \n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":5,"text":"Exactly. By using the ESMS, we can ensure that the displays meet the required standards and provide a better experience for consumers.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":6,"text":"Yes, that's correct. The depth and pulse energy used for creating the voids are different for each shot, and we observed that the voids are created at a shallower depth for the shots with a larger pulse energy. This could also affect the overall performance of the material.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":7,"text":"Yes, that's correct. It could also have an effect on the durability or resistance to chemical exposure of the concrete. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of recycled LCD glass sand on HPC.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":8,"text":"The 3D printing process creates a solid and clean surface, allowing for the touch display and sensing apparatus to be inserted accurately and efficiently. This method helps streamline the process and produce the final product faster.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":9,"text":"Absolutely. It's essential to consider the specific requirements of an application when determining the most suitable approach.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-solar-10.7b-v1.0","metadata":{}}
