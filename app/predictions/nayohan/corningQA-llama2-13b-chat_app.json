{"question_id":1,"text":"The substrate is flat in both cases, so the effective area of the surface is the same for both the laser spot and the overall surface. This ensures that we are comparing apples to apples in our analysis.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":2,"text":"Oh, you should definitely give it a try. You might be surprised at how much more comfortable and immersive your viewing experience can be.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":3,"text":"It represents the factor of 5x improvement in mobility compared to previous assumptions.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":4,"text":"Definitely. I wonder what the future holds for Field Emission Displays.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":5,"text":"Exactly. With the ESMS, we can accurately measure and improve the edge strength of free-form displays, leading to better performance and longer lifespan.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":6,"text":"Exactly. The deeper the voids are created, the higher they will be in relation to the front surface. This is due to the shift in the focal point.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":7,"text":"Exactly. It shows that the use of recycled LCD glass sand can improve the overall strength and durability of the concrete.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
{"question_id":8,"text":"It allows for the creation of a fully functional and interactive touch display, which can be integrated into the final product. This adds an extra layer of complexity and intricacy to the final model.\n\n<\/s>","model_id":"nayohan\/corningQA-llama2-13b-chat","metadata":{}}
